sightread.htm
--------------

This is an HTML document that displays musical scores and implements various sightreading exercises. It's being developed for a piano teaching studio and is a work-in-progress.

Any feedback is greatly appreciated! At the bottom of the document, there's a Google Docs form for on-the-spot comments.

Current functions:
- Loads and parses [MusicXML](http://www.makemusic.com/musicxml) files, which can be generated by most music composition software (such as Finale, Sibelius) and by music OCR programs such as SmartScore.
- Displays the score with the [Vexflow](http://vexflow.com) HTML library
- Allows the user to turn pages
- Allows the user to rearrange measures of a score (to create new sightreadable permutations)

Misc. notes:
- The way that music is displayed has an important effect on a musician's ability to sightread it. So I will be adding a UI for the user to strategically adjust the VexFlow parameters. In long term, the diplay algorithms will be tweaked for ease of sightreading.
- If the notes of a certain measure run over into the next measure, then the measure width is too small. Currently, this parameter is static and must be changed manually in the HTML document. This will be changed when other features are implemented - see the above point.
- At this stage, particular MusicXML files must be directly inserted into the HTML. There are some examples already included for testing purposes.
